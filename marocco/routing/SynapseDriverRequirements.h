/** class to calculate the number of required synapse drivers for incoming L1
 * routes in order to realize all synapses to neurons on the HICANN.
 *
 * Incoming synaptic connections are defined by certain ``bio properties'',
 * namely a 6 bit L1 Address of the source neuron, the target neuron, and
 * synapse parameters like the synaptic weight, the short term plasticity
 * parameters, and the synapse type (e.g. excitatory or inhibitory).
 * In contrast, many of the hardware synapse parameters can not be set per
 * synapse but are shared per synapse row, synapse driver or synapse column.
 * In fact, the following constraints must be considered:
 *  - The short term plasticity settings are set once per synapse driver.
 *  - Each synapse decodes the 4 LSB of the L1 address, the 2 MSB are set per
 *    half synapse row. A half synapse row contains all synapses of a row with
 *    the same column parity.
 *  - All synapses of one row connect to either the left or the right synaptic
 *    input circuit of the neuron (settable per row)
 *  - When only two types of synapses are used (excitatory and inhibitory),
 *    these can be mapped to the left(right) synaptic input of the neuron.
 *    However, when more than two different synaptic time constants are
 *    desired, these parameters must be mapped to different synaptic input
 *    circuits on different denmems within a logical neuron, which
 *    complicates the routing.
 *
 * This class computes the number of synapse drivers required to realize all
 * synapses, considering all the constraints listed above.
 * As a simplification, we consider only the STP mode, and not the settings for
 * the usable efficacy. The STP time constant must be chosen per HICANN
 * quadrant anyhow.
 *
 * Possible extensions:
 *  - consider the synaptic weight range per row is limited to 16 different
 *    values, typically spanning 1 order of magnitude. We could extract for
 *    each synapse a weight order and request different synapse rows for
 *    different orders of magnitude.
 *  - consider the routing priority
